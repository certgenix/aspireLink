# AspireLink - Mentorship Platform

## Overview

AspireLink is a full-stack web application that connects students with experienced professionals through a structured 4-month mentorship program. The platform features a modern React frontend with TypeScript, Express.js backend, and is designed for easy deployment with both development and production environments.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API**: RESTful API design with JSON responses
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling
- **Storage**: Pluggable storage interface with in-memory implementation

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL (via environment variable)

## Key Components

### Shared Schema (`/shared/schema.ts`)
- User management with username/password authentication
- Contact form submissions with timestamps
- Zod validation schemas for type-safe data handling
- Drizzle table definitions for PostgreSQL

### Storage Layer (`/server/storage.ts`)
- Abstract `IStorage` interface for data operations
- `MemStorage` implementation for development/testing
- CRUD operations for users and contacts
- Designed for easy swapping to database-backed storage

### Frontend Pages
- **Home**: Landing page with hero section and feature highlights
- **About**: Company information and mission statement
- **For Students**: Student application information and eligibility
- **For Mentors**: Mentor recruitment and benefits
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions with collapsible sections
- **Contact**: Contact form with validation and submission handling

### UI System
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Custom color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support through CSS variables

## Data Flow

### Contact Form Submission
1. User fills out contact form on frontend
2. Form data validated using Zod schema
3. POST request to `/api/contact` endpoint
4. Server validates data and stores via storage interface
5. Success/error response sent back to client
6. Toast notification displayed to user

### Page Navigation
1. User clicks navigation links
2. Wouter handles client-side routing
3. Components render with React Query for data fetching
4. UI updates without full page reload

## External Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Query
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Backend**: Express.js, Drizzle ORM, Neon Database client
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Utilities**: date-fns, clsx for conditional classes

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild for production builds
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across stack
- **Development**: tsx for running TypeScript directly

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- tsx for running TypeScript backend directly
- In-memory storage for rapid development
- Replit-specific plugins for enhanced development experience

### Production Build
1. Vite builds optimized frontend bundle to `/dist/public`
2. esbuild bundles backend code to `/dist/index.js`
3. Single Node.js process serves both API and static files
4. Environment variables configure database connection

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required for production)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Scaling Considerations
- Stateless backend design allows horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling through Neon serverless
- CDN-ready static asset generation
- Session storage can be moved to external store (Redis/PostgreSQL)
