# AspireLink - Mentorship Platform

## Overview
AspireLink is a full-stack web application facilitating a 4-month mentorship program between students and experienced professionals. The platform's core purpose is to connect ambition with experience, offering a structured program that is entirely volunteer-based. Key capabilities include comprehensive student and mentor registration, an admin dashboard for managing the mentorship program, and robust user management. The vision is to empower the next generation by providing accessible, high-quality mentorship.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui library built on Radix UI primitives.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, responsive and mobile-first.
- **Theming**: Dark mode support via CSS variables, custom color palette with distinct gradients for hero sections across pages (e.g., About, Contact, FAQ) for visual consistency and branding.
- **Iconography**: Use of Lucide React icons (e.g., FileText, UserCheck, Calendar, Award) with solid colored backgrounds for process steps and features, replacing previous emoji or numbered circles for better consistency and readability.
- **Branding**: Custom AspireLink logo and favicon, consistent professional imagery, and accurate program messaging across the site.
- **Accessibility**: Focus on high-contrast text (charcoal color for all text), WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support.
- **Animations**: Global hover animations (hover-lift, hover-scale, hover-glow, card-hover) and keyframe animations (fadeInUp, fadeIn, slideInLeft, pulse-soft) for smooth, polished interactions throughout the app.
- **Data Visualization**: Professional charts using recharts library (AreaChart, PieChart, BarChart, RadialBarChart) with simple stat cards for dashboard experiences.
- **Color Theme**: Blue-based accent color scheme (hsl 202) for better contrast and theme consistency across light/dark modes.
- **Dashboard Design**: Consistent minimal layouts for both student and mentor dashboards with simple stat cards, sessions overview bar chart, two-column grids, and "Edit Application" buttons for profile updates.
- **Session Management**: Mentors can schedule, reschedule, and mark sessions as completed. When scheduling sessions with students in multiple cohorts, mentors can select which cohort to assign the session to. Completed sessions are tracked across admin and student dashboards.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds, Wouter for client-side routing, TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript with ESM modules, RESTful API design with JSON responses.
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for all data storage (migrated from PostgreSQL). No SQL database required.
- **Validation**: Zod for type-safe data handling and robust form validation (e.g., email format, mandatory fields for registration).
- **Storage**: FirestoreStorage implementation with auto-increment counters for numeric IDs.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user management, Admin login with hardcoded credentials for program management.
- **Session Management**: Memory-based session store (sessions expire on server restart).
- **Registration-First Flow**: 
    - Users fill out student or mentor registration forms WITHOUT needing to create an account first.
    - Registration data is stored in separate Firestore collections: `studentRegistration` and `mentorRegistration`.
    - After form submission, success page shows "Sign Up Now" and "Login" buttons (NOT "Go to Dashboard").
    - On signup/signin, the system checks for existing registrations matching the user's email.
    - If a matching registration is found, it's automatically linked to the new account and the user is assigned the appropriate role.
    - Users who sign up without a prior registration are redirected to `/complete-profile` to choose their role and fill out the appropriate form.
    - A global RoleGuard ensures users without roles cannot access protected areas of the app.
    - **Google Sign-In**: Both SignUp and SignIn pages support Google authentication with the same auto-linking logic.
    - **Email Pre-fill**: Registration success pages pass the email to signup page for convenience.
