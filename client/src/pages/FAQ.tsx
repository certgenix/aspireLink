      question: "How does the matching process work?",
      answer:
        "Our smart matching system connects students with mentors based on career goals, industry interests, personality compatibility, and availability. We consider factors like communication style, professional background, and specific areas of expertise to ensure the best possible pairing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the time commitment for mentors?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is there a cost to participate?",
      answer:
        "AspireLink is completely free for both students and mentors. Our program is entirely volunteer-based, with mentors generously donating their time and expertise to help the next generation of professionals succeed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the 4-month program ends?",
      answer:
        "While the formal program ends after 4 months, many mentor-mentee pairs continue their relationship independently. We also host annual networking events to maintain connections within the AspireLink community.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "How are students selected for the program?",
      answer:
        "Students must complete an application and receive a nomination from faculty, academic advisors, or peers. We look for students who demonstrate commitment, clear career goals, and the potential to benefit from mentorship.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if a mentor-mentee pairing isn't working out?",
      answer:
        "We understand that not every pairing is perfect. Our program coordinators are available to help resolve any issues or facilitate a re-matching if necessary. We want to ensure a positive experience for everyone involved.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often do cohorts start?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support is provided during the program?",
      answer:
        "Participants receive structured guidance materials, goal-setting templates, and access to our program coordinators. We also provide resources on effective mentoring practices and professional development.",
